This package is used to create a `ggplot` object showing the pre-1890 counties of Scotland. The boundary data is in the `scotland_df` object, and the `scocounties()` convenience function plots those data (excluding the Northern Isles by default). Look at the definition of that function to customize what's shown.

To use:

````r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('anghyflawn/scotmappR')
library(scotmappR)
````
